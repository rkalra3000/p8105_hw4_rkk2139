Welcome to my website! I invite you to explore my academic and professional journey and learn more about me.

### About Me

I'm Riya, currently pursuing a Master of Science in Biostatistics at Columbia University, with a background in Bioinformatics from UC San Diego. My professional interests include healthcare, data science, and public health. 

In my free time I love running, exploring the outdoors, trying new restaurants in NYC, and learning new styles of dance!
